# ESLint Custom Guidelines

## ESLint Disable Comments

- Do not use `// eslint-disable-next-line` or other ESLint disable comments unless specifically instructed by the user.

## Post-Linting Verification

- After fixing any lint issue, ALWAYS run `yarn checks`.
- If `yarn checks` reports any further issues, fix all of them.
- Ensure `yarn checks` completes with no errors before considering the linting task complete.
