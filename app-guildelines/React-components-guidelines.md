1. Always make the React component mobile first and mobile friendly.    
2. Always use Material-UI (MUI) for UI components and styling.
3. Keep React components small, simple and focused on a single responsibility.
4. If a component is getting too complex, break it down into smaller components, and use the top level component to compose them.
5. Use proper component structure and organization.
6. seperate logic to custom hooks if necessary (if logic is getting too complex or big)
